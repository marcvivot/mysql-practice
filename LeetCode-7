Finding the earliest login date for players of a game
https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-i/submissions/1785531276/

This is one of the solutions, which taught me about min and group by functions
SELECT
    player_id,
    MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM
    Activity
GROUP BY
    player_id;

I was trying to solve this problem with a Inner Join Function but couldnt resolve the fact that one of the players didnt have a duplicate thus not falling into my WHERE function range
Select p1.player_id, p1.event_date AS first_login
From Activity p1
Inner Join Activity p2
on p1.player_id = p2.player_id
Where p1.event_date < p2.event_date
;

Id treid using a AND IS NULL function but no avail

After consulting chatGPT it offered using a LEFT JOIN which I thought could only be used on different tables and not within the same table + it used the AND function first and WHERE last

SELECT p1.player_id,
       p1.event_date AS first_login
FROM Activity p1
LEFT JOIN Activity p2
  ON p1.player_id = p2.player_id
  AND p1.event_date > p2.event_date
WHERE p2.event_date IS NULL;
